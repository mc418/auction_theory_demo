# auction_theory_demo
2 demo project based on ascending price auction and first price auction
In place of collecting rents from opposing players, both players collect rent from the bank equal to 10% of property value at 4 points: After the 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th properties are sold. At the end of the game, each player adds the total value of all properties owned to see who wins.
The game has 20 properties: 8 valued at $100, 8 at $200, and 4 at $300. That makes a total of $3600 in value. Each player starts with $700 in cash. User and computer take turns bidding, one bid per property and the amount is in $5 units. High bidder takes the property and pays for it, but the other player has the advantage of having the first bid on the next property. The hint has a number that tells what the computer thinks the property is worth bidding.
In general, hints ending in 3,4,8,9 show compy thinks it is better to bid higher, since it is better to lose 1 or 2 than for the opponent to gain 3 or 4.
